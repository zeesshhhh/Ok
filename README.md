## Crypto futures coins
`FUTURES_TOP_N` in config.py (default 30) adds the top USDT perpetual coins by 24h volume, scanned with OKX data on 15m, 30m, 1H, 4H and 1D. They run every strategy but are always tagged experimental. Set it to 0 to switch off. Binance coins outside the top N are available in the app's Scanner tab only.

## Honest limits
- True HFT needs colocated servers and microsecond latency. GitHub Actions cannot do it. The bot only reads order-book imbalance at scan time.
- Arbitrage and copy trading are alerts. Fees, withdrawal time and USD-vs-USDT premiums often erase small spreads.
- Yahoo data can be delayed or patchy, and forex volume is mostly missing.
- Backtests ignore slippage in fast markets. Judge strategies by their paper-trading record, not one backtest.
- Analysis only, not financial advice.

## Android app (APK)
The bot publishes `docs/feed.json` after each run. The app reads it, so the repo must be public.
1. Run the Signal bot workflow once so `docs/feed.json` exists.
2. Actions > Build APK > Run workflow (about 10 minutes).
3. Open the repo's Releases page on your phone, download `signal-bot.apk`, and allow "install unknown apps" when asked.
4. Tabs: Markets, Scanner, Signals, News, Alerts, Account (the bot's paper trades), Paper (the app's own paper trades), Report. Pull down to refresh.

### In-app auto paper trading (Paper tab)
- Switch on Auto paper trading. Choose the coins (top 20, 50 or 100 by 24h volume) and the timeframes (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d). When a candle closes on a chosen timeframe, the app checks each coin once on that candle and opens virtual trades from signals that meet your minimum strength and quality filter. Signals more than 60% of a candle old are skipped so entries are never stale.
- Rules: 1.2+ reward to risk, one open trade per coin and timeframe, none during a high-impact news window, cooldown after a close. 1% risk per trade, 0.05R fees, same-candle stop and target counts as a loss.
- Quality filter (Paper tab, default 3 of 5). Before a scanner trade opens, the app re-checks it: the verdict must hold on the closed candle (the forming candle repaints), price must not be stretched over 3 ATR from EMA20 or RSI exhausted, volume must not be dead, and the next higher timeframe must not oppose it. Altcoins also must not fight the Bitcoin 1h and 4h trend. Five points are then scored: next timeframe agrees, the one above agrees, volume 1.2x average or more, ADX 20+, and funding and news not crowded against it. Choose Off, 3 of 5 or 4 of 5. Quality is logged per trade, so the Paper tab and CSV show whether the filter actually improves results.
- Markets tab has a Paper trade this button for a manual entry.
- Stops, targets and timeouts are checked every 60 seconds while the app is open. On reopening, the app replays candles since entry, so hits made while it was closed are still recorded.
- Accuracy: win rate, average R, profit factor, hit target vs stop vs timeout, breakdown by timeframe, direction, signal strength and coin, plus a short list of the best and worst groups.
- Download logs: in-app CSV, bot CSV, or both at once (share sheet, or copy to clipboard). Column names match, so the two can be compared. Send the files to tune the bot.

### Keeping your data between installs
Builds are now signed with a fixed key (app_src/debug.keystore) and a rising version number, so a new APK installs over the old one and keeps your paper trades and Lab data. The one time you move from an older APK to this one, Android will ask you to uninstall first, which erases the old data. Use All logs to export before that. Data is stored as files in the app's own folder, written safely, and never overwritten if it cannot be read.

### Signal Lab (Lab tab)
- Switch it on and keep the app open. At every candle close (15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, optional 5m) for the top 10, 20 or 40 coins, it records the vote of every indicator (trend, momentum, volume, breakout, support/resistance, candle patterns, overall verdict).
- 6 candles later it scores each vote: direction right or wrong, how far price moved in ATR, and a race test (+1.5 ATR before -1.5 ATR).
- The tab compares trading styles (Scalping 15m, Intraday 1h, Swing 4h, Position 1d), indicator families and each single indicator, best first. Anything under 30 signals is greyed out.
- Download the accuracy table, the raw snapshots, or All logs (also includes paper trades and the bot log).

- Trades live on the phone only. Clearing app data or Reset deletes them, so download first.
Telegram stays your push-notification channel. The app is for viewing.
